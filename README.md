## 📖 Overview

Deepfakes generated using modern AI models have become increasingly realistic, making manual detection extremely difficult. This project presents an **Explainable Deepfake Detection System** built using a **fine-tuned DINOv2 Vision Transformer** for video-level classification.

The application allows users to upload a video and receive:

- 🎯 Real/Fake prediction
- 📊 Confidence score
- 🖼️ Top suspicious frames
- 📈 Frame-wise fake probability timeline
- 📄 Downloadable forensic report

The goal is not only to classify videos accurately but also to provide **visual evidence** supporting the prediction.
